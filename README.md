# Inspiration
Donald Knuth noted in the past that the game called mastermind, can be solved in N amount of rounds. I plan to program this game and apply his algorithm through the use of an AI agent or have a series of steps so the user can try.

# Tutorial Phase (6/22/19 - Complete)
- The game at first can be a little tricky and I want the people to understand how it's played. So if you've never played mastermind go through the tutorial I hope I explained it well.

# Update
- **6/29/2019** Menu added and way to generate a random color, I'm most likely going to use a struct to minimize the game and make it easier to handle.

- **7/4/2019** Added a authentication system to make sure the game wouldn't debunk at random spots now all that is left is the results algorithm and I'm thinking of a way to make the game appealing in the results stage.

- **7/6/2019** Structs are GREAT!!! I makes the code packagable and it helps with readibility I think.
