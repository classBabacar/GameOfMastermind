# Inspiration
Donald Knuth noted in the past that the game called mastermind, can be solved in N amount of rounds. I plan to program this game and apply his algorithm through the use of an AI agent or have a series of steps so the user can try.

# Tutorial Phase (6/22/19 - Complete)
- The game at first can be a little tricky and I want the people to understand how it's played. So if you've never played mastermind go through the tutorial I hope I explained it well.

# Update
- **6/22/2019** I think I came up with a good algorithm to help the game scale now. Now the user can enter any value of 2 , 4 , 6 , N+2... and the display scales with the help of recursion.
