# Inspiration
Donald Knuth noted in the past that the game called mastermind, can be solved in N amount of rounds. I plan to program this game and apply his algorithm through the use of an AI agent or have a series of steps so the user can try.

# Tutorial Phase 
- The game at first can be a little tricky and I want the people to understand how it's played.

# Things to come
- I'm still figuring out how I want to display the colors to the user.
